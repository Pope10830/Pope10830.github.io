Linking Galleries is a web app made for MShed Bristol.  
It's an interactive map that displays information about locations of interest in and around Bristol.  

[MShed](https://www.bristolmuseums.org.uk/m-shed/) is a museum which contains exhibits about the history of Bristol.  
A team of 4 of us created this for them as part of our SPE (Software Product Engineering) coursework.  

It uses the [React js](https://reactjs.org/) library for the frontend and [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) for the backend to create an [API](https://linkinggalleries.docs.apiary.io/#).
