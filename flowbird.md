During my time at Flowbird I have worked on multiple projects across a number of different devices.
I have quickly progressed, moving from a Graduate Software Engineer to Software Delivery Lead in just 3 years.

My first project was a PoC that I worked on as the sole developer.
It was a web based application created using the Vue JS framework.  
The project also integrated with multiple AWS resources such as AWS Polly, AWS Sumerian and AWS Lex to allow an avatar to talk to a user and answer basic queries.  
I used my experience from the CGI module at university to model and animate the avatar.

I then worked on an existing WPF application as part of a team to add a feature that allowed users to get assistance from a remote agent via a video call.  
I also worked on the Java backend solution for sending new configuration to the devices and spent some time performing a QA role.    
During this project I gained my first experience of working as part of a development team in the workplace.   
I learned to use new tools such as Jira for tracking work and Confluence for producing documentation.

My managers recognised my ability to work and communicate effectively as part of a team and gave me an opportunity to lead a team on a different project.   
This project is to create a device that will allow the top-up and purchase of smartcards for travel.  
As Team Lead it is my responsibility to provide updates on the status of the project, communicate with other teams to collaborate and share common code and make sure we resolve any blockers.  
As Scrum Master, I run the agile ceremonies and help the product owner prioritise and plan the remaining work.  
In order to help with this new role, Flowbird organised for me to go on an agile training course in which I got my Scrum Master Certification.  
We went through a major handover period in May 2022 in which most of the developers left the team (they were part of an external company).  
I helped guide the team through this tricky period and get new team members up to speed whilst maintaining a good sprint velocity.  
I am also a developer on this project and have gained experience working with C# and WPF as well as using tools such as Bitbucket and Jenkins for version control and automated building.

Since then I have been promoted to lead a bigger team of around 12 engineers (some of which based in other countries) creating ticketing applications for multiple devices across a number of customers.
We have successfully delivered software releases containing both new features and fixing issues found during testing.
I have run retrospectives to get input from the team on areas that could be improved, and followed up to make sure these are actioned.
I have worked on projects where there have been complex branching strategies due to parallel delivery streams that needed to be released at different times.
I have been heavily involved in triage, refinement and estimation to ensure the backlog is in a fit state for development, effectively acting as both Scrum Master and Product Owner at the same time.
Recently I have taken on line management responsibilities and have been managing 3 junior team members, focusing on resolving any issues they raise and ensuring career development plans are in place.

On top of all this I have proposed and implemented a large number of process improvements.
I took on the responsibility of Jira administration to allow myself to make changes to our workflows and the fields we use.
This enabled me to introduce the use of metrics which we regularly review to see what other improvements we can make.
I introduced the use of Jira Plan views to allow better delivery/release planning.
I formalised the BVT/SIT test phases as part of the release process making sure it was documented for consistent use across teams.
I put together and proposed a standard format for end of sprint communications that is now in use across the business unit.
I proposed and documented a new versioning process as it was inconsistent across teams meaning we have a better understanding of the software we are releasing.
This list is not extensive, I have been described by my managers as a 'Change Agent', constantly looking to drive forward with improvements. Not just making suggestions but actually pushing to implement change.
