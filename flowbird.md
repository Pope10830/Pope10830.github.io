During my time at Flowbird I have worked on multiple projects.

My first project was a PoC that I worked on as the sole developer.
It was a web based application created using the Vue JS framework.  
The project also integrated with multiple AWS resources such as AWS Polly, AWS Sumerian and AWS Lex to allow an avatar to talk to a user and answer basic queries.  
I used my experience from the CGI module at university to model and animate the avatar.

I then worked on an existing WPF application as part of a team to add a feature that allowed users to get assistance from a remote agent via a video call.  
I also worked on the Java backend solution for sending new configuration to the devices and spent some time as a QA.    
During this project I gained my first experience of working as part of a development team in the workplace.   
I learned to use new tools such as Jira for tracking work and Confluence for producing documentation.

My managers recognised my ability to work and communicate effectively as part of a team and gave me an opportunity to lead a team on a different project.   
This project is to create a device that will allow the top-up and purchase of smartcards for travel.  
As Team Lead it is my responsibility to provide updates on the status of the project, communicate with other teams to collaborate and share common code and make sure we resolve any blockers.  
I also act as Scrum Master so I run the meetings throughout the sprint and help the product owner prioritise the remaining work.  
In order to help with this new role, Flowbird organised for me to go on an agile training course in which I got my Scrum Master Certification.  
We went through a major handover period in May 2022 in which most of the developers left the team (they were part of an external company).  
I helped guide the team through this tricky period and get new team members up to speed whilst maintaining a good sprint velocity.  
I am also a developer on this project and have gained experience working with C# and WPF as well as using tools such as Bitbucket and Jenkins for version control and automated building.
