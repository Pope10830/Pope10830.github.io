While working at Flowbird I have created a web based application using the Vue JS framework.  
The project also integrates with multiple AWS resources such as AWS Polly, AWS Sumerian and AWS Lex.  

I have gained experience working as part of a team as well as using my initiative to make decisions on my own.  
I have learned more about agile methodologies and tools such as Jira and Confluence.
