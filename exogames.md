The EXOGames project is my CGI unit coursework.  
We have to design and model, exoskeleton body armour for an EXO Games athlete, and then animate an athlete in it.

For this I used Autodesk Maya and generated a character using the [Autodesk Character Generator](https://charactergenerator.autodesk.com/).  
I used polygon modelling and set driven key to provide the secondary animation such as the jetpack opening and closing.  
I used constraints to parent the exosuit so it moves correctly with the athlete when animating it.  
I will use Mayas HumanIK Control Rig to animate the athlete using pose to pose animation.
