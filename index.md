## Skills and Qualities

> Good Leader                    -  I've demonstrated strong leadership skills to help my teams continue to maintain good velocity through major handover periods, and created an environment where my team are able to collaborate and feel comfortable to bring forward suggestions on ways we can improve.

> Excellent Interpersonal Skills -  I show excellent interpersonal skills in my role as team lead to communicate effectively with stakeholders and the rest of the development team. At Flowbird I have introduced a new process for end of sprint communications to ensure all teams are providing the same level of feedback to stakeholders.

> Determination                  -  I demonstrated resilience when completing the Edinburgh Marathon in May 2019.

> Problem Solving                -  I am very good at creating efficient solutions to logical problems which has aided project work both in University, personally and at work. Initially I used this in software development, I now apply my skills to drive forward process improvements to increase software quality and ensure we deliver our commitments on time and on cost.

> Level-Headed                   -  I work well under pressure as proven by my exceptional exam results. I have further proven this skill by effectively triaging bugs, and adjusting delivery plans in a timely manner when required.

> Time Management                -  I have excellent prioritisation skills and am able to deliver work to a strict deadline while managing multiple commitments to a number of different customers.

> Change Agent                   -  I have been described by my managers as a Change Agent, I am willing to challenge the status quo and always looking for ways to improve the way we are working. I am not happy with just throwing out suggestions, I always look to make sure changes are realised.
