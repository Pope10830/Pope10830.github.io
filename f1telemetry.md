title: F1 2020 Telemetry (WIP)
description: Program that processes telemetry data for F1 2020 Game

This is a program that I have created for recreational purposes that runs alongside the F1 2020 game.  
It is a Java application that processes live telemetry data that is output from the game via a UDP stream.  
It displays this live data for the user to view during the race as well as processing it for post-race analysis.
